Group Members: Wilmena Manaloto, Jennifer Tee

We will be creating an Android app using AppInventor. Our app will be a coloring book for children from around three to eight years old. It will be used for entertainment purposes. The app will have different categories, such as People, Animals, and tv show/movie/book characters. We will implement coding from MapTour and PaintPot.

In terms of dividing the work, Wilmena will mostly work on the coding for the buttons and colors. Jennifer will work on the coding for lists/categories. We might add a function to the app that makes the coloring book similar to a game. A point system will be related to how someone colors within the lines. Another idea is to make it impossible to color outside the lines.

a.	Find pictures
b.	Organize the pictures into categories
